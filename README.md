# 2022-Winter
First Page of Winter 2022

This page is a reflection during the start of 2022.
The month of the year before had just turned over onto the new month in 2022.

This very small project helped me practice gathering typical site folders...
    ...though some of the folders were empty.

This project also helped me practice...
    ...adding parallax-effect, &
    ...superimposed transparency using CSS.
