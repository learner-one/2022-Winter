            <br>2022 Winter<br><br>
            Uncertain the mountain will catch<br>
            Enough flakes and flurries and snow;<br>
            The fire to not return,<br>
            At least neither to evict<br>
            Nor march hooves to the end.<br>
            The air has been dense as before,<br>
            But it has forced the multitude apart.<br>
            Some have resisted the distance.<br>
            But obduracy and indignation<br>
            Lead gasps, regret, then silence.<br>
            Rumor is that war again is coming.<br>
            No one cares to first know<br>
            That the fetters fathom<br>
            By fathom have long since tarried.<br>
            The white and cold renewal<br>
            Comes around the edge of leaf,<br>
            From page of one onto another;<br>
            This time may just deliver<br>
            The dove that has for very long<br>
            Repeatedly been anticipated.<br>
            But new as the month may be,<br>
            The boisterous laughter is replete<br>
            With all things but felicity.<br>
            A dozen waxing and waning<br>
            May bring them back to life<br>
            Or take even more than bargained.<br>
